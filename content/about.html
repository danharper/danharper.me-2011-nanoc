<p>I’ve been involved in web development for the past <del>four</del> <ins>five</ins> years now and have gained experience in all kinds of exciting new technologies from the latest advances in CSS to the amazing Ruby on Rails web framework.</p>

<p>I’ve found a passion for teaching the skills I’ve learnt and have published a number of popular tutorials on the <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/author/danharper">Tuts+ network</a>.</p>

<p>I’m currently in my second year of study at the University of Portsmouth towards a BSc in Web Technologies. On that note, I’m currently looking for a company to work with for a year from August/September 2011 for my “year in industry”. If you know of any vacancies, or could offer any advice please get <a href="mailto:intouch@danharper.me">intouch@danharper.me</a>.</p>
