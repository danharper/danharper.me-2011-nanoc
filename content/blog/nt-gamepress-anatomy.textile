"GamePress":http://themeforest.net/item/gamepress/17397?ref=danharper is a "Gaming News & Reviews" theme for WordPress and currently one of the most popular themes at "ThemeForest":http://themeforest.net/?ref=danharper. It is the most advanced theme Iâ€™ve created so far, and really pushes what the WordPress engine can do!

This two-part series will focuses on several key areas of the theme which seem to be some of the major selling points. I will also include examples of any important code used and provide links to various tutorials detailing similar techniques.
