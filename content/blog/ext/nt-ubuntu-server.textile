In this tutorial and screencast, you’ll learn how to turn that old computer you have lying around into a full-featured test bed for your websites!

We’ll set up a typical LAMP server with Ubuntu Server 10.10, using Apache 2, PHP 5, MySQL 5.5 and SQLite3. We'll also build in support for your Ruby on Rails 3 apps!

Don't have a spare computer to set up a server, but want to try it out? You can use a Virtual Machine instead - in fact that's what I'm doing in the screencast!
